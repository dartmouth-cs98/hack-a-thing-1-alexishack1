## What I Built
I followed three Unity tutorials to build 3 games. The first was a personalized Karting Game that is a set demo in Unity. The second was a Nav Mesh tutorial that harnessed Unity's AI NavMesh capabilities to move a character around. The third was a "Roll-a-ball" game. All three games are playable and show some of what Unity can do.

## What I Learned
I have never used Unity before; I didn't even know this kind of platform existed. It took me a while to get a hang of the UI/where to look for certain components, but I think I definitely got a better handle of it by the Roll-a-Ball tutorial (the third one I did). I learned how to use Unity Engine's built in functions/objects to write scripts which made my games more interactive and animated, which was super cool. For example, I wrote a script which made my game tokens rotate automatically and another that moved my game player to wherever the player of the game clicked on the game board. I had no idea how easy it would be to design a game, especially in terms of graphics, which I assumed would be very difficult to build and animate. I think I could confidently build a game on my own after doing these tutorials, but I have a lot more to learn about the more advanced animations that are possible in Unity.

## What Didn't Work
Though in the end I liked the fact that Unity is a mix of code and clickable UI, I had a lot of trouble at first figuring out where everything was and how to use the different features. During my second tutorial I accidentally changed one of the selections in my NavMesh (I had the character set to an ogre and not a human), which took me over an hour to figure out. I think it probably gets there with more advanced scripting, but I would have liked more explicit, well laid out selections in code. After doing a few tutorials, I finally got the hang of the lay out of the Unity app. I also had a bug because I moved a folder and Unity did not like that, which also took me a while to figure out. My last problem was figuring out how to get my game to show up on the web (it worked for the first pre-set Unity tutorial I did). It took a ton of googling/trying surge and other things to realize that Unity is not SUPER compatible with web games (at least I still couldn't figure it out). I think the Nav Mesh tutorial, which I did second, also assumed a much higher level of Unity knowledge, so I definitely struggled a lot with the speed of it (though I was able to do most of it after a while!).
